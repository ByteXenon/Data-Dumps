# Data-Dumps
## **\~Dumpin' the hate you give\~**
This data dump is 100% legal. This data was not purchased by me, it is purely my work.\
Most of .json files here look like this:
```
{
  "3.90.213.108": {
    "port": 80,
    "org": "Amazon Data Services NoVa",
    "transport": "tcp",
    "version": "2.4.29",
    "isp": "Amazon.com, Inc.",
    "tags": ["cloud"],
    "hostnames": ["ec2-3-90-213-108.compute-1.amazonaws.com"],
    "domains": ["amazonaws.com"],
    "city": "Ashburn",
    "state": "VA",
    "vulns": {
      "CVE-2022-26377": {
        "cvss": 5.0,
        "verified": false
      },
      "CVE-2006-20001": {
        "cvss": null,
        "verified": false
      }
    },
    "cloud": {
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "service": "EC2",
      "provider": "Amazon"
    },
    "http": {
      "status": 200,
      "title": "Index of /",
      components": {}
    }
  }
}
```
Sorry, Github doesn't allow me to upload files larger than 25MB and have this repository store more than 1GB here.\
But I don't care.

For IoT dump requests email me, I will do it for free.
