# Data-Dumps
## **\~Dumpin' the hate you give\~**
This data dump is 100% legal, I used my own money and my skiddy scripting skills to get it.\
If you don't agree with me, email me here: danielgtdavis@proton.me \
Most of CVE files look like this:
```
{
  "146.6.100.161": {
    "os": Linux,
    "port": 443,
    "isp": "University of Texas at Austin",
    "tags": ["ics", "cloud"],
    "hostnames": ["beg.utexas.edu"],
    "domains": ["utexas.edu"], 
    "city": Austin,
    "vulns": {"CVE-2022-0778": {"cvss": 5.0, "verified": false}}
  }
}
```
Sorry, Github doesn't allow me to upload files larger than 25MB and have this repository store more than 1GB here.\
But I don't care.
